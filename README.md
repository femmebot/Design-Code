## ICP School Attendance Policies
Students must adhere to institution-wide policies on attendance and conduct.

Punctuality and attendance are required. The first time you are absent, you will be excused, but I request that you email me at least two hours before class begins. After that, any absence or significant lateness must be accompanied by a doctorâ€™s letter, or some other form of official explanation, or your grade will be affected. If you have three absences, you will fail the class.


## ICP School Grading Policy Guidelines

At the completion of each course taken, instructors submit grades and attendance records. Written evaluations are completed for each student for all MFA classes and for Certificate Seminar classes. Grades and evaluations are distributed after the end of each term.

An Official ICP Transcript will be mailed to the student at the end of the year or upon completion of their respective program.

F-1 students are also required to maintain passing grades throughout their course of study at ICP in order to maintain their full-time student status. Failure of one or more courses can result in SEVIS termination.

Students will be evaluated using these criteria:  
* Creativity and/or originality
* Execution and result
* Technical excellence
* Participation in critiques and discussions
* Attendance and punctuality
* Completion of lab assignments

## Attendance Policy
Students must attend at least 8 full classes.

A letter grade will be issued for 10-week classes.

An F grade is given when a student has attended the class, but has not completed enough assignments and work to pass.

An NF grade is given when a student has not attended the minimum number of classes.

Incompletes will only be given if a student fails to complete a significant portion of course work for reasons of health or extraordinary circumstances, and only with the consent of the Chair. Students must complete the work and have it evaluated by the instructor before the end of the following term. Incompletes are not given in the last term of the academic year.
