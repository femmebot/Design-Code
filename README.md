## Description

In this hands-on course, you will learn how to take the basic building blocks of the web&mdash;HTML &amp; CSS&mdash;to build your own websites using current, web development best practices. You will also become familiar with Interaction Design &amp; apply the principles of good User Experience to your own web projects.


## Course Goals and Learning Objectives
* Develop a working knowledge of HTML and CSS to build responsive websites that include a portfolio and an HTML/CSS-based narrative capstone project.
* Obtain a good grasp of the design-to-production workflow and adopt web development best practices.
* Use Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to design high-fidelity mockups and create graphical assets for web production.
* Apply user-centered, Interaction Design principles and methodologies to design usable sites that meet targeted users' needs and expectations.
* Become comfortable using the command line to navigate and perform simple file management tasks on your desktop.
* Learn the basics of Git for managing project revision histories.
* Use GitHub for project hosting and collaboration.


## Technology Requirements
* Mac laptop running OSX Yosemite (10.10.0 +)
* Adobe Photoshop (CS5 +)
* Adobe Illustrator (CS5 +)


## Class Format
Class sessions are divided into two parts with a break in between: (1) lectures and code-along demos, and (2) working labs where students complete an in-class, lecture-based exercise. Guest lecturers will be invited on occasion to discuss specific design and/or web development topics and provide additional perspectives on the industry. For the Midterms and the Finals, students will be presenting work that demonstrates their comprehensive knowledge of the material covered up to that point.

## ICP School Attendance Policies
Students must adhere to institution-wide policies on attendance and conduct.

Punctuality and attendance are required. The first time you are absent, you will be excused, but I request that you email me at least two hours before class begins. After that, any absence or significant lateness must be accompanied by a doctor’s letter, or some other form of official explanation, or your grade will be affected. If you have three absences, you will fail the class.


## ICP School Grading Policy Guidelines

At the completion of each course taken, instructors submit grades and attendance records. Written evaluations are completed for each student for all MFA classes and for Certificate Seminar classes. Grades and evaluations are distributed after the end of each term.

An Official ICP Transcript will be mailed to the student at the end of the year or upon completion of their respective program.

F-1 students are also required to maintain passing grades throughout their course of study at ICP in order to maintain their full-time student status. Failure of one or more courses can result in SEVIS termination.

Students will be evaluated using these criteria:  
* Participation in critiques and discussions: 5%
* Attendance and punctuality: 5%
* Completion of lab assignments: 30%
* Midterm Project: 30%
* Final Project: 30%

Lab assignments, the Midterm project and Final project will be evaluated on the following criteria:
* Creativity and originality
* Execution and result
* Technical excellence
* Punctuality 

## Attendance Policy
Students must attend at least 8 full classes.

A letter grade will be issued for 10-week classes.

An F grade is given when a student has attended the class, but has not completed enough assignments and work to pass.

An NF grade is given when a student has not attended the minimum number of classes.

Incompletes will only be given if a student fails to complete a significant portion of course work for reasons of health or extraordinary circumstances, and only with the consent of the Chair. Students must complete the work and have it evaluated by the instructor before the end of the following term. Incompletes are not given in the last term of the academic year.
